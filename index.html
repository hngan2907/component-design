    <h2>Introduction to note making</h2>
    <p>One of the most valuable skills you need to develop at university is the ability to make notes effectively. Good skills in taking and making notes will help you, as an active learner, to organise, categorise and recall information you can use
      when completing assignments or revising for exams. You can experiment with different strategies to find those which best suit your purpose and learning style.</p>

        <h3>Note making strategies</h3>
        <p>Planning how to go about taking and making notes involves thinking about techniques, tools, layouts and how you will use your notes. There are also some issues to consider such as permission to make audio recordings of lectures or to
          photograph slide presentations.</p>
